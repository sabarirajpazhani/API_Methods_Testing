## API Testing

API Testing is a type of software testing that focuses on verifying the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). It involves sending requests to API endpoints and validating the response against expected outcomes. API testing ensures that the API behaves as intended and meets the requirements.

### API Methods

APIs typically use the following methods to perform various operations:

- **GET**: Retrieves data from the server.
- **POST**: Submits new data to the server.
- **PUT**: Updates existing data on the server or creates a new resource if it doesn't exist.
- **DELETE**: Removes data from the server.
- **PATCH**: Applies partial modifications to a resource on the server.
- **HEAD**: Similar to GET but retrieves only the headers of the response, not the body.
- **OPTIONS**: Describes the communication options for the target resource, often used for CORS preflight requests.

Each method is designed to perform a specific action, and understanding their use cases is essential for effective API testing.

### API Testing Tools

For testing APIs, you can use the following tools:

- **Thunder Client**: A lightweight REST client extension for VS Code that allows you to test APIs quickly and easily within the editor.
